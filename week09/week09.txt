calloc

int *Pnumbers = (int * )calloc(50, size_of(int)):
sometimes casting is not needed eg.

capacity = 10
int *pName = calloc(capacity, size_of(int)):

initlialise all values to zero


realloc

used to extend already allocated memory block

two args
a pointer to a location in memory that has been alocated previously by malloc or calloc
the size_of(type)

keeps all the contents of the old allocated memory and copies it into the new allocation


capacity = 15
int pMoreNames - realloc(pNames, capacity*size_of(int))
free(pName)
pName = pMoreNames


realloc deallocates the orginally allocated memory

bitwise operators
