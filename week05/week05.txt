pointer

pointer address increase by 1 adds 4 bytes to the address for integer
becuase each integer takes up 4 bytes

double will use 8 bytes

sizeof(number)/sizeof(numbers[0])- length of array
the total size of the array divided by the size of the first element

ie total size 24 bytes / int(4 bytes) - = length of 6
we use this as the condition in a for loop
