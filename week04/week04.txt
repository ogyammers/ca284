pointers

always init pointer to NULL

int *pnumber = NULL;

unlesss int *pnumber = &number


pointer = returns the address
*pointer = return the value at that address

%d, number = the number
%p, &number = address of number
%d, *pnumber = value of number
%p, pnumber = address stored in pnumber

*pletter++ = compiler works from right to left, first increments
                the pointer and then acceses the value at the new incremented pointer
                ** this is usually incorrect behavior
